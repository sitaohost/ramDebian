Source: https://www.ntpsec.org
Comment:
 The tarball is repacked because upstream uses the waf build system, which is
 shipped in the tarball as a binary blob.  The binary includes the source,
 but Debian considers that backwards, so we run a debian/repack-waf script to
 fix that.  See also: https://wiki.debian.org/UnpackWaf

Comment: This is not compatible with upstream libisc. The NTPsec lead developer
         says they have made changes to the API.  Here is their comment, from
         libisc/README:
           The code in this directory derives from an old version (91) of
           the ISC export library shipped with BIND9.  Most of the code in that
           library was not needed and has been discarded.

Comment: This is currently used.  The plan is to create a standalone package of
         libjsmn (from the upstream sources).  Then, this package would build
         against that. Note that several other packages in Debian (including
         ntp) currently embed libjsmn.  They could also be fixed to use the
         standalone libjsmn package once it is created.

     LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
     ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
     INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
     REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
     PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
     THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
     HEREUNDER.
 .
 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
 and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
 authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
 the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
 scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
 of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
 works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
 and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
 These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
 culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
 works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
 part through the use and efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
 expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
 associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
 is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
 elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
 terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
 Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
 Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
 limited to, the following:
 .
   i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
      communicate, and translate a Work;
  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
 iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
      likeness depicted in a Work;
  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
   v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
      in a Work;
  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation
      thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
      directive); and
 vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
      world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
      implementations thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
 of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
 irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
 Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
 of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
 future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
 worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
 treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
 medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
 including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
 purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
 member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
 successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
 revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
 equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
 as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
 be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
 Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
 account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
 extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
 person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
 irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
 Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
 maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
 time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
 of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
 limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
 "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
 applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
 reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
 partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
 of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
 will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
 Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
 action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
 express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
     surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
     warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
     statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
     title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
     infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
     the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
     the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
     that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
     limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
     Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
     consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
     Work.
  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
     party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
     this CC0 or use of the Work.

 Creative Commons Corporation (âCreative Commonsâ) is not a law firm and
 does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative
 Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other
 relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information
 available on an âas-isâ basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties

 Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
 .
 Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
 conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original
 works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other
 rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations
 are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part
 of our licenses.
 .
 Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by
 those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways
 otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
 irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of
 the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all
 rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse
 the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not
 subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material
 used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for
 licensors.
 .
 Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a
 licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under
 specified terms and conditions. If the licensorâs permission is not
 necessary for any reasonâfor example, because of any applicable exception
 or limitation to copyrightâthen that use is not regulated by the license.
 Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights
 that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may
 still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have
 copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special
 requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although
 not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests
 where reasonable. More considerations for the public. <<endOptional>>

 Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License
 .
 By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
 bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public
 License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights
 in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the
 Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor
 receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
 conditions.
 .
 Section 1 â Definitions.
 .
      a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
 Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which
 the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or
 otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and
 Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License,
 where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound
 recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
 synched in timed relation with a moving image.
 .
      b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and
 Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with
 the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
      c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
 closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance,
 broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard
 to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public
 License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and
 Similar Rights.
 .
      d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
 absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling
 obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December
 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
 .
      e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any
 other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to
 Your use of the Licensed Material.
 .
      f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or
 other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
 .
      g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms
 and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
 Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
 Licensor has authority to license.
 .
      h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under
 this Public License.
 .
      i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process
 that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction,
 public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination,
 communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public
 including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a
 place and at a time individually chosen by them.
 .
      j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
 resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the
 Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended
 and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in
 the world.
 .
      k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
 under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
 .
 Section 2 â Scope.
 .
      a. License grant.
 .
           1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
 non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the
 Licensed Material to:
 .
                A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in
 part; and
 .
                B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 .
           2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
 Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not
 apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
 .
           3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
 6(a).
 .
           4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
 authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats
 whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
 necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right
 or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to
 exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to
 circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public
 License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never
 produces Adapted Material.
 .
           5. Downstream recipients.
 .
                A. Offer from the Licensor â Licensed Material. Every
 recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
 Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of
 this Public License.
 .
                B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
 additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective
 Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts
 exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
 .
           6.  No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
 may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your
 use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or
 granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive
 attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
 b. Other rights.
 .
           1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed
 under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
 personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives
 and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
 limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but
 not otherwise.
 .
           2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public
 License.
 .
           3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
 royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly
 or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or
 compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
 reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 Section 3 â License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
      a. Attribution.
 .
           1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form),
 You must:
 .
                A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with
 the Licensed Material:
 .
                     i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
 Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable
 manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
 .
                     ii. a copyright notice;
 .
                     iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
 .
                     iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
 .
                     v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
 extent reasonably practicable;
 .
                B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain
 an indication of any previous modifications; and
 .
                C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
 Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this
 Public License.
 .
           2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
 reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share
 the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
 conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the
 required information.
 .
           3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
 information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably
 practicable.
 .
           4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License
 You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying
 with this Public License.
 .
 Section 4 â Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
 Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
      a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
 extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
 contents of the database;
 .
      b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents
 in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the
 database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its
 individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
 .
      c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all
 or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
 Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
 other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 Section 5 â Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
      a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
 possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,
 and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
 Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This
 includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
 for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
 defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known
 or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or
 in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
 .
      b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to
 You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or
 otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential,
 punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out
 of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor
 has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or
 damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part,
 this limitation may not apply to You.
 .
      c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
 above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most
 closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
 .
 Section 6 â Term and Termination.
 .
      a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
 Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
 License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
 .
      b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
 Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
           1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it
 is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
 .
           2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
      c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
 right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this
 Public License.
 .
      d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
 Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed
 Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public
 License.
 .
      e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
 .
 Section 7 â Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
      a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms
 or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 .
      b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
 Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the
 terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 Section 8 â Interpretation.
 .
      a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall
 not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any
 use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission
 under this Public License.
 .
      b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
 deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum
 extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed,
 it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the
 enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
 .
      c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
 failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
 .
      d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
 limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to
 the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction
 or authority.
 .
 Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding,
 Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it
