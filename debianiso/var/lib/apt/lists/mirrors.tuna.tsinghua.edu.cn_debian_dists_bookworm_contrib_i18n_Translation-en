Package: libamgcl-dev
Description-md5: ec65c5ece2e2ac48e9fba2a354789071
Description-en: Solves large sparse linear systems with algebraic multigrid method
 AMG is one of the most effective iterative methods for solution of equation
 systems arising, for example, from discretizing PDEs on unstructured grids. The
 method can be used as a black-box solver for various computational problems,
 since it does not require any information about the underlying geometry. AMG is
 often used not as a standalone solver but as a preconditioner within an
 iterative solver (e.g. Conjugate Gradients, BiCGStab, or GMRES).
 .
 AMGCL builds the AMG hierarchy on a CPU and then transfers it to one of the
 provided backends. This allows for transparent acceleration of the solution
 phase with help of OpenCL, CUDA, or OpenMP technologies. Users may provide
 their own backends which enables tight integration between AMGCL and the user
 code.
 .
 AMG is a header-only C++ library, with the headers provided by this package.

Package: dynare-matlab
Description-md5: 90e8fcabb135fcf60e09f0be51774946
Description-en: MATLAB support for Dynare
 Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models, in
 particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and overlapping
 generations (OLG) models. The models solved by Dynare include those relying on
 the rational expectations hypothesis, wherein agents form their expectations
 about the future in a way consistent with the model. But Dynare is also able
 to handle models where expectations are formed differently: on one extreme,
 models where agents perfectly anticipate the future; on the other extreme,
 models where agents have limited rationality or imperfect knowledge of the
 state of the economy and, hence, form their expectations through a learning
 process. In terms of types of agents, models solved by Dynare can incorporate
 consumers, productive firms, governments, monetary authorities, investors and
 financial intermediaries. Some degree of heterogeneity can be achieved by
 including several distinct classes of agents in each of the aforementioned
 agent categories.
 .
 Dynare offers a user-friendly and intuitive way of describing these models. It
 is able to perform simulations of the model given a calibration of the model
 parameters and is also able to estimate these parameters given a dataset. In
 practice, the user will write a text file containing the list of model
 variables, the dynamic equations linking these variables together, the
 computing tasks to be performed and the desired graphical or numerical
 outputs.
 .
 This package is only useful to users having MATLAB installed on their
 machine. It contains the source of the MEX files and will recompile them using
 the existing MATLAB installation.

Description-en: Launcher for proprietary games
 Various games are divided into two logical parts: engine
 and data. Often the engine and data are licensed in
 different ways, such that the engine can be distributed
 in Debian but the data cannot.

 started by a special launcher script that will create symbolic
 links or do other setup. This package contains those launcher
 scripts.
 .
 The following games currently require this package:
 .
  * Doom 2: The Master Levels
  * Quake series
  * Unreal
  * Unreal Gold

Description-en: Open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2
 OpenRCT2 is an open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2
 (RCT2). The gameplay revolves around building and maintaining an
 amusement park containing attractions, shops and facilities. The player
 must try to make a profit and maintain a good park reputation whilst
 keeping the guests happy. OpenRCT2 allows for both scenario and sandbox
 play. Scenarios require the player to complete a certain objective in a
 set time limit whilst sandbox allows the player to build a more flexible
 park with optionally no restrictions or finance.
 .
 RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 was originally written by Chris Sawyer in x86
 assembly and is the sequel to RollerCoaster Tycoon. The engine was based
 on Transport Tycoon, an older game which also has an equivalent
 open-source project, OpenTTD. OpenRCT2 attempts to provide everything
 from RCT2 as well as many improvements and additional features, some of
 these include support for modern platforms, an improved interface,
 improved guest and staff AI, more editing tools, increased limits, and
 cooperative multiplayer. It also re-introduces mechanics from RollerCoaster
 Tycoon that were not present in RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Some of those
 include; mountain tool in-game, the "have fun" objective, launched coasters
 (not passing-through the station) and several buttons on the toolbar.

Package: repo
Description-md5: 1496a967d4bcbc0d6ebc3348869abf22
Description-en: repository management tool built on top of git
 Repo is a repository management tool that the Android developers built on top
 of Git. Repo unifies the many Git repositories when necessary, does the
 uploads to the Android revision control system, and automates parts of the
 Android development workflow. Repo is not meant to replace Git, only to make
 it easier to work with Git in the context of Android. The repo command is an
 executable Python script that you can put anywhere in your path. In working
 with the Android source files, you will use Repo for across-network
 operations. For example, with a single Repo command you can download files
 from multiple repositories into your local working directory.
 .
 repo is an unusual tool because it downloads all of its own Python modules
 using GPG-signed git tags, and stores those files as part of the project that
 it is working with.  So this package just provides the wrapper script, which
 provides the GPG signing keys for verifying that the correct Python code was
 downloaded.

Description-en: Simple and powerful network transmission of ZFS snapshots
 simplesnap is a simple way to send ZFS snapshots across a net‐
 work. Although it can serve many purposes, its primary goal is
 to manage backups from one ZFS filesystem to a backup filesystem
 also running ZFS, using incremental backups to minimize network
 traffic and disk usage.
 .
 simplesnap it is designed to perfectly compliment
 snapshotting tools, permitting rotating backups with arbitrary
 retention periods. It lets multiple machines back up a single
 target, lets one machine back up multiple targets, and keeps it
 all straight.
 .
 simplesnap is easy; there is no configuration file needed. One
 ZFS property is available to exclude datasets/filesystems. ZFS
 datasets are automatically discovered on machines being backed
 up.
 .
 simplesnap  is robust in the face of interrupted
 transfers, and needs little help to keep running.
 .
 Unlike many similar tools, simplesnap does not
 require full root access to the machines being backed up. It
 runs only a small wrapper as root, and the wrapper has only three
 commands it implements.

 Maybe it was the fact that people got to blow away Nazis. Maybe it was the
 sheer challenge of it all. For whatever reason, Wolfenstein 3-D and Spear of
 Destiny, pioneered the first-person shooter genre and brought its legendary
 creators, id Software, worldwide notoriety and numerous awards. In fact, The
 Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame recognized Wolfenstein 3D as helping to
 shape the overall direction of the computer gaming industry.

 Wolf4SDL is an open-source port of id Software's classic first-person shooter
 Wolfenstein 3-D to the cross-platform multimedia library "Simple DirectMedia
 Layer (SDL)" (http://www.libsdl.org). It is meant to keep the original feel
 while taking advantage of some improvements.
