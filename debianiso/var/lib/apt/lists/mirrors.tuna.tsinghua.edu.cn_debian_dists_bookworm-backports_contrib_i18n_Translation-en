Package: diaspora-installer
Description-md5: 120c7fb469648e6eb3e942926e8b1ea0
Description-en: distributed social networking service - installer
 Diaspora (currently styled diaspora* and formerly styled DIASPORA*) is a free
 personal web server that implements a distributed social networking service.
 Installations of the software form nodes (termed "pods") which make up the
 distributed Diaspora social network.
 .
 Diaspora is intended to address privacy concerns related to centralized
 social networks by allowing users to set up their own server (or "pod") to
 host content; pods can then interact to share status updates, photographs,
 and other social data. It allows its users to host their data with a
 traditional web host, a cloud-based host, an ISP, or a friend. The framework,
 which is being built on Ruby on Rails, is free software and can be
 experimented with by external developers.
 .

 This dummy package downloads diaspora (also pulling in runtime
 dependencies as rubygems) and configures it to use PostgreSQL and
 Nginx.
 .
 Unlike the normal Debian package, this package installs exact versions of the
 dependencies supported by upstream.

 JOSM is an editor for OpenStreetMap (OSM) written in Java.
 The current version supports stand alone GPX tracks, GPX track data
 from OSM database and existing nodes, line segments and metadata tags
 from the OSM database.
 .
 OpenStreetMap is a project aimed squarely at creating and providing
 free geographic data such as street maps to anyone who wants them.
 The project was started because most maps you think of as free actually
 have legal or technical restrictions on their use, holding back people
 from using them in creative, productive or unexpected ways.
 .
 This package provides a script to install the upstream JARs.

Package: openrct2
Description-md5: 136f2157dc662607863d657b37a31ab7
Description-en: Open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2
 OpenRCT2 is an open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2
 (RCT2). The gameplay revolves around building and maintaining an
 amusement park containing attractions, shops and facilities. The player
 must try to make a profit and maintain a good park reputation whilst
 keeping the guests happy. OpenRCT2 allows for both scenario and sandbox
 play. Scenarios require the player to complete a certain objective in a
 set time limit whilst sandbox allows the player to build a more flexible
 park with optionally no restrictions or finance.
 .
 RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 was originally written by Chris Sawyer in x86
 assembly and is the sequel to RollerCoaster Tycoon. The engine was based
 on Transport Tycoon, an older game which also has an equivalent
 open-source project, OpenTTD. OpenRCT2 attempts to provide everything
 from RCT2 as well as many improvements and additional features, some of
 these include support for modern platforms, an improved interface,
 improved guest and staff AI, more editing tools, increased limits, and
 cooperative multiplayer. It also re-introduces mechanics from RollerCoaster
 Tycoon that were not present in RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Some of those
 include; mountain tool in-game, the "have fun" objective, launched coasters
 (not passing-through the station) and several buttons on the toolbar.
