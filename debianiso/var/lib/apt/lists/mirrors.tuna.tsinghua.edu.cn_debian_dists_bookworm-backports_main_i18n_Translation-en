Description-en: autoconf like tool
 ACR (Auto Conf Replacement) is an autoconf like tool that allows you to create
 configure scripts for your programs. The main aim of this tool is to teach
 developers how to create portable builds of their tools, just using generic
 functions wrapped by acr to generate portable shellscript.
 .
 Pros:
   * Easy to learn / implement.

   * Own syntax, not complex m4 macros.
   * Reverse engineering tool to recover .acr files from the final configure
     script.
   * Good documentation and tutorials.
   * vim syntax highlighting for configure.acr files
     ($PREFIX/share/acr/vim/install.sh)
   * Debugging support (-d)
   * Integrated support for java, bash, perl, Tcl, c, c++, ruby and Python.
   * Recursive configure script calls.
   * Progress bar in generation stage.
 .
 Cons:
   * Not recommended for huge projects
   * Slow script generation parsing huge configuration files
   * No automake replace. (just type clean makefiles and acr substs)
   * Not enough tested (only on free operating systems (Open|Net|Free|Dfly)BSD,
     GNU systems, and Darwin).
 .
 This package provides the following components:
   * acr        : generate configure scripts.
   * acr-cat    : show configure.acr file from a generated configure script.
   * acr-install: '/usr/bin/install' program wrapper.
   * acr-sh     : acr configure script generator.

 upgrade .deb packages for a number of machines on a local network.
 Each package is downloaded from a remote site only once,
 regardless of how many local clients install it.
 The approx cache typically requires a few gigabytes of disk space.
 .
 Approx also simplifies the administration of client machines:
 repository locations need only be changed in approx's configuration file,
 not in every client's /etc/apt/sources.list file.
 .
 Approx can be used as a replacement for apt-proxy,
 with no need to modify clients' /etc/apt/sources.list files,
 or as an alternative to apt-cacher.

 BINoculars is a tool for data reduction and analysis of large sets of
 surface diffraction data that have been acquired with a
 two-dimensional X-ray detector. The intensity of each pixel of a
 two-dimensional detector is projected onto a three-dimensional grid
 in reciprocal-lattice coordinates using a binning algorithm. This
 allows for fast acquisition and processing of high-resolution data
 sets and results in a significant reduction of the size of the data
 set. The subsequent analysis then proceeds in reciprocal space. It
 has evolved from the specific needs of the ID03 beamline at the ESRF,
 but it has a modular design and can be easily adjusted and extended
 to work with data from other beamlines or from other measurement

Description-en: Surface X-ray diffraction 2D detector data reduction - Documentation
 BINoculars is a tool for data reduction and analysis of large sets of
 surface diffraction data that have been acquired with a
 two-dimensional X-ray detector. The intensity of each pixel of a
 two-dimensional detector is projected onto a three-dimensional grid
 in reciprocal-lattice coordinates using a binning algorithm. This
 allows for fast acquisition and processing of high-resolution data
 sets and results in a significant reduction of the size of the data
 set. The subsequent analysis then proceeds in reciprocal space. It
 has evolved from the specific needs of the ID03 beamline at the ESRF,
 but it has a modular design and can be easily adjusted and extended
 to work with data from other beamlines or from other measurement
 techniques.

Package: borgbackup
Description-md5: 8a56876615c13f6f25a373ef5d5c2017
Description-en: deduplicating and compressing backup program
 Borg is a deduplicating and compressing backup program. Optionally, it
 also supports authenticated encryption. It was forked from the attic
 backup program.
 .
 The main goal of Borg is to provide an efficient and secure way to
 backup data. The data deduplication technique used makes Borg suitable
 for daily backups since only the changes are stored. The authenticated
 encryption makes it suitable for backups to not fully trusted targets.
 .
 It can push backups to remote repositories accessed via ssh. A client
 pushing a backup invokes "borg serve" on the repository host. It is
 possible to restrict the ssh key to "borg serve" using the
 authorized_keys command= clause.
 .
 Please note that the server and the client should be on the same
 version of borgbackup. Using different versions of borgbackup on
 client and server might result in 'incompatible API version' error
 messages and a non-working backup.
 .
 While there is no direct operations mode for pull-type backups, you
 can configure the backup target in append-only mode, preventing the
 backup source from deleting or altering previous backups.

Package: erlang-luerl
Description-md5: ba0442956c0172294ab501db8dfd5616
Description-en: implementation of Lua in Erlang
 An experimental implementation of Lua 5.2 written solely in pure Erlang
 .
 When to use Luerl:
 .
 Fast Language Switch: Luerl should allow you to switch between Erlang and Lua
 incredibly fast, introducing a way to use very small bits of logic programmed
 in Lua, inside an Erlang application, with good performance.
 .
 Multicore: Luerl provides a way to transparently utilize multicores. The
 underlying Erlang VM takes care of the distribution.
 .
 Microprocesses: It should give you a Lua environment that allows you to
 effortlessly run tens of thousands of Lua processes in parallel, leveraging
 the famed microprocesses implementation of the Erlang VM. The empty Luerl
 State footprint will be yet smaller than the C Lua State footprint.
 .
 Forking Up: Because of the immutable nature of the Luerl VM, it becomes a
 natural operation to use the same Lua State as a starting point for multiple
 parallel calculations.
 .
 However, Luerl will generally run slower than a reasonable native Lua
 implementation. This is mainly due the emulation of mutable data on top of an
 immutable world. There is really no way around this. An alternative would be
 to implement a special Lua memory outside of the normal Erlang, but this would
 defeat the purpose of Luerl. It would instead be then more logical to connect
 to a native Lua.
 .
 Some valid use cases for Luerl are:
  * Lua code will be run only occasionally and it wouldn't be worth managing
    an extra language implementation in the application;
  * the Lua code chunks are small so the slower speed is weighed up by Luerl's
    faster interface;
  * the Lua code calculates and reads variables more than changing them;
  * the same Lua State is repeatedly used to 'fork up' as a basis for
    massively many parallel calculations, based on the same state;
  * it is easy to run multiple instances of Luerl which could better utilise
    multicores.

Package: erlang-p1-pkix
Description-md5: 17490bcd12287b68f22b6961bdae9b3c
Description-en: PKIX certificates management library for Erlang
 The idea of the library is to simplify certificates configuration in Erlang
 programs. Typically an Erlang program which needs certificates  (for HTTPS/
 MQTT/XMPP/etc) provides a bunch of options such as certfile,  chainfile,
 privkey, etc. The situation becomes even more complicated when a  server
 supports so called virtual domains because a program is typically  required to
 match a virtual domain with its certificate. If a user has plenty  of virtual
 domains it's quickly becoming a nightmare for them to configure all this.
 The complexity also leads to errors: a single configuration mistake and a
 program generates obscure log messages, unreadable Erlang tracebacks or,
 even worse, just silently ignores the errors.
 Fortunately, the large part of certificates configuration can be automated,
 reducing a user configuration to something as simple as:
 .
 certfiles:
   - /etc/letsencrypt/live/*/*.pem
 .
 The purpose of this library is to do this dirty job under the hood.

Package: erlang-p1-xmpp
Description-md5: b8c0f1b7110aa2c36d3a69bd6b85e659
Description-en: Erlang/Elixir XMPP parsing and serialization library
 This library provides comprehensive representation of XMPP elements as
 well as tools to work with them. Every such element is represented by an
 Erlang record. Most of the library's code is auto generated and thus
 considered to be bug free and efficient.
 .
 The approach is very similar to ASN.1, Google Protocol Buffers or Apache
 Thrift: an XML element is transformed into internal language structure
 (an Erlang record in this case) - the process known as "decoding". During
 decoding, validation is also performed, thus well-typed structures are
 generated, potentially decreasing bugs related to handcrafted parsing. A
 reverse process known as "encoding" is applied for transforming an
 Erlang record into an XML element.
 .
 This package should be used along with erlang-p1-xml, because it is
 only able to decode from and encode to structures generated by that
 library (that is, xmlel() elements).

 versioning, or expectation that any two commits will be compatible with

 boilerplate code. The down side is that the code needs to be written in
 an asynchronous style, which is not idiomatic to Go, so it can take some

Description-en: implementation of bitsets
 This package implements bitsets, a mapping between non-negative integers
 and boolean values.  It should be more efficient than map[uint] bool.
 .
 It provides methods for setting, clearing, flipping, and testing
 individual integers.
 .
 But it also provides set intersection, union, difference, complement,
 and symmetric operations, as well as tests to check whether any, all,
 or no bits are set, and querying a bitset's current length and number
 of positive bits.
 .
 BitSets are expanded to the size of the largest set bit; the memory
 allocation is approximately Max bits, where Max is the largest set
 bit. BitSets are never shrunk. On creation, a hint can be given for the
 number of bits that will be used.
 .
 Many of the methods, including Set, Clear, and Flip, return a BitSet
 pointer, which allows for chaining.

Package: golang-github-bmatcuk-doublestar-dev
Description-md5: 8ff9ae0e45df4fa1490d9545b797d79b
Description-en: support for double star matches in golang's path.Match and filepath.Glob
 This package contains a Golang implementation of path pattern matching
 and globbing with support for "doublestar" (aka globstar: **) patterns.
 .
 doublestar patterns match files and directories recursively. For example,
 if you had the following directory structure:
 .
 grandparent `-- parent
     |-- child1 `-- child2
 .
 You could find the children with patterns such as: **/child*,
 grandparent/**/child?, **/parent/*, or even just ** by itself (which
 will return all files and directories recursively).
 .
 Bash's globstar is doublestar's inspiration and, as such, works similarly.
 Note that the doublestar must appear as a path component by itself. A
 pattern such as /path** is invalid and will be treated the same as
 /path*, but /path*/** should achieve the desired result. Additionally,
 /path/** will match all directories and files under the path directory,
 but /path/**/ will only match directories.

 including:
 .
  • LoggingHandler for logging HTTP requests in the Apache Common Log Format
    (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/logs.html#common).
  • CombinedLoggingHandler for logging HTTP requests in the Apache Combined Log
    Format (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/logs.html#combined) commonly used
    by both Apache and nginx.
  • CompressHandler for gzipping responses.
  • ContentTypeHandler for validating requests against a list of accepted
    content types.
  • MethodHandler for matching HTTP methods against handlers in a
    map[string]http.Handler
  • ProxyHeaders for populating r.RemoteAddr and r.URL.Scheme based on the
    X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP, X-Forwarded-Proto and RFC7239 Forwarded headers
    when running a Go server behind a HTTP reverse proxy.
  • CanonicalHost for re-directing to the preferred host when handling multiple

Package: golang-github-gorilla-mux-dev
Description-md5: d61faf184d480e712a34f9f9497bde59
Description-en: powerful URL router and dispatcher for golang
 Package gorilla/mux implements a request router and dispatcher.
 .
 The name mux stands for "HTTP request multiplexer". Like the standard
 http.ServeMux, mux.Router matches incoming requests against a list of
 registered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL
 or other conditions. The main features are:
 .
  * Requests can be matched based on URL host, path, path prefix, schemes,
    header and query values, HTTP methods or using custom matchers.
  * URL hosts and paths can have variables with an optional regular expression.
  * Registered URLs can be built, or "reversed", which helps maintaining
    references to resources.
  * Routes can be used as subrouters: nested routes are only tested if the
    parent route matches. This is useful to define groups of routes that share
    common conditions like a host, a path prefix or other repeated attributes.
    As a bonus, this optimizes request matching.
  * It implements the http.Handler interface so it is compatible with the
    standard http.ServeMux.

Description-en: Extremely flexible golang deep comparison
 go-testdeep is historically a go rewrite and adaptation of wonderful
 Test::Deep perl.
 .
 In golang, comparing data structure is usually done using
 reflect.DeepEqual or using a  package that uses this function behind
 the scene.
 .
 This function works very well, but it is not flexible. Both compared
 structures must match exactly and when a difference is returned, it is
 up to the caller to display it. Not easy when comparing big data
 structures.
 .
 The purpose of go-testdeep, via the td package and its helpers, is to
 do its best to introduce this missing flexibility using "operators",
 when the expected value (or one of its component) cannot be matched
 exactly, mixed with some useful comparison functions.

Description-md5: 7d013eafd7ef0e904ed7fce463597709
Description-en: K-Sortable Globally Unique IDs (Go library)
 ksuid is an efficient, comprehensive, battle-tested Go library for
 generating and parsing a specific kind of globally unique identifier
 called a *KSUID*. This library serves as its reference implementation.
 .
 What is a KSUID?
 .
 KSUID is for K-Sortable Unique IDentifier. It is a kind of globally
 unique identifier similar to a RFC 4122 UUID, built from the ground-up
 to be "naturally" sorted by generation timestamp without any special
 type-aware logic.
 .
 In short, running a set of KSUIDs through the UNIX sort command will
 result in a list ordered by generation time.
 .
 Why use KSUIDs?
 .
 There are numerous methods for generating unique identifiers, so why
 KSUID?
 .
  1. Naturally ordered by generation time
  2. Collision-free, coordination-free, dependency-free
  3. Highly portable representations
 .

Package: golang-github-willf-bloom-dev
Description-md5: fa8321fa96c077c668f1fdb1878fa848
Description-en: Go package implementing Bloom filters
 A Bloom filter is a representation of a set of n items, where the main
 requirement is to make membership queries; i.e., whether an item is a
 member of a set.
 .
 A Bloom filter has two parameters: m, a maximum size (typically a
 reasonably large multiple of the cardinality of the set to represent)
 and k, the number of hashing functions on elements of the set. (The
 actual hashing functions are important, too, but this is not a
 parameter for this implementation). A Bloom filter is backed by a BitSet
 (https://github.com/willf/bitset); a key is represented in the filter
 by setting the bits at each value of the  hashing functions (modulo
 m). Set membership is done by testing whether the bits at each value of
 the hashing functions (again, modulo m) are set. If so, the item is in
 the set. If the item is actually in the set, a Bloom filter will never
 fail (the true positive rate is 1.0); but it is susceptible to false
 positives. The art is to choose k and m correctly.
 .
 In this implementation, the hashing functions used is murmurhash
 (github.com/spaolacci/murmur3), a non-cryptographic hashing function.

 This subrepository holds experimental and deprecated (in the "old" directory)
 packages.

 The idea for this subrepository originated as the "pkg/exp" directory of the
 main repository, but its presence there made it unavailable to users of the
 binary downloads of the Go installation. The subrepository has therefore been
 created to make it possible to "go get" these packages.
 .
 Warning: Packages here are experimental and unreliable. Some may one day be
 promoted to the main repository or other subrepository, or they may be modified
 arbitrarily or even disappear altogether.

 In short, code in this subrepository is not subject to the Go 1 compatibility
 promise. (No subrepo is, but the promise is even more likely to be violated by
 go.exp than the others.)

Package: gpsprune
Description-md5: 4cd2b69a33c05e4615249da27b877da9
Description-en: visualize, edit, convert and prune GPS data
 GpsPrune is an application for viewing, editing and converting coordinate
 data from GPS systems. It's a tool for preparing GPS data before you go on a
 trip, and for playing with your collected GPS data after you get home again.
 .
 It can load data from arbitrary text-based formats (for example, any
 tab-separated or comma-separated file) or XML, or directly from a GPS
 receiver. It can display the data (as map view using OpenStreetMap
 images and as altitude profile), edit this data (for example delete
 points and ranges, sort waypoints, compress tracks), and save the data
 (in various text-based formats). It can also export data as a GPX
 file, or as KML/KMZ for import into Google Earth, or send it to a GPS
 receiver.
 .
 Some example uses of GpsPrune include cleaning up tracks by deleting
 wayward points - either recorded by error or by unintended detours. It
 can also be used to compare and combine tracks, convert to and from
 various formats, compress tracks, export data to Google Earth, or to
 analyse data to calculate distances, altitudes and so on.
 .
 Furthermore, GpsPrune is able to display the tracks in 3d format and
 lets you spin the model round to look at it from various directions.
 You can also export the model in POV format so that you can render a
 nice picture using Povray. You can also create charts of altitudes or
 speeds. It can also load Jpegs and read their coordinates from the
 EXIF tags, and export thumbnails of these photos to Kmz format so that
 they appear as popups in Google Earth. If your photos don't have
 coordinates yet, GpsPrune can be used to connect them (either manually or
 automatically using the photo timestamps) to data points, and write
 these coordinates into the EXIF tags.

 OTR allows you to have private conversations over IM by providing:
  * Encryption - no one else can read your instant messages.
  * Authentication - you are assured the correspondent is who you think
    it is.
  * Deniability - the messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures
    that are checkable by a third party. Anyone can forge messages after
    a conversation to make them look like they came from you. However,
    _during_ a conversation, correspondents are assured the messages
    they see are authentic and unmodified.
  * Forward secrecy - if you lose control of your private keys,
    no previous conversation is compromised.

Package: jdupes
Description-md5: c39c2d10a5bfd8aedad8944d3ef07d4f
Description-en: identify and delete or link duplicate files
 jdupes is a program based in fdupes. The main goal of jdupes is identify
 and taking actions upon duplicate files. In comparison with fdupes, jdupes
 is heavily modified from and improved.
 .
 The biggest reason to use jdupes is raw speed. In testing on various data
 sets, jdupes is over 7 times faster than fdupes-1.51 on average.
 .
 Code in jdupes is written with data loss avoidance as the highest priority.
 If a choice must be made between being aggressive or careful, the careful
 way is always chosen.
 .
 jdupes includes features that are not found in fdupes. Examples of such
 features include btrfs block-level deduplication and control over which
 file is kept when a match set is automatically deleted. jdupes is not
 afraid of dropping features of low value; a prime example is the -1 switch
 which outputs all matches in a set on one line, a feature which was found
 to be useless in real-world tests and therefore thrown out.
 .
 jdupes can convert duplicate files in hardlinks or relative softlinks. It
 is useful in several scenarios, as in Debian packaging, to create relative
 symlinks to lots of duplicate files (it will substitute rdfind + symlinks
 commands, used to same purpose, when solving lintian duplicate-files).
 .
 Packages build for Linux versions have support to btrfs filesystem.

 shouldn't in order to avoid resource oversubscription. The module
 collects different attributes such as the request URL, HTTP request
 and response headers, the IP source address, the HTTP response code,
 history data (user session and on per source IP address basis), the
 number of concurrent requests to the server (total or requests having
 similar attributes), the number of concurrent TCP connections (total
 or from a single source IP), and so forth.

 Counteractive measures to enforce the defined rules are: request
 blocking, dynamic timeout adjustment, request delay, response
 throttling, and dropping of TCP connections.

Description-en: document processor
 LyX is an almost WYSIWYG-frontend for LaTeX. It makes the power and
 typesetting quality of LaTeX available for people who are used to
 word processors. Since LyX supports LaTeX's concept of general
 mark-ups, it is even easier and faster to create professional quality
 documents with it than with usual word processors. It is also
 possible to use LaTeX commands within LyX, so nothing of LaTeX's
 power is lost.
 .
 You can extend the functionality of LyX by installing these packages:
  * chktex: check for typographical errors
  * gnuhtml2latex: import HTML documents
  * groff: improved table formatting in plain text exports
  * gnumeric: import spreadsheats
  * librsvg2-bin, inkscape: use the SVG image format in LyX documents
  * lilypond: support for musical sheets
  * maxima: integrated CAS support for equation evaluation
  * mythes-*: use the OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice Thesaurus
  * noweb, r-cran-knitr: use literate programming
  * rcs, cvs, svn, git: integrated version control
  * texlive-xetex/luatex: use the XeTeX/LuaTeX typesetting system
  * wv: import MS Word documents
  * xsltproc (or saxon with openjdk-17-jre), docbook-xsl: ePub export

 Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a server that allows remote access for
 playing audio files (Ogg-Vorbis, FLAC, MP3, Wave, and AIFF), streams
 (Ogg-Vorbis, MP3) and managing playlists.  Gapless playback, buffered
 output, and crossfading support is also included.  The design focus is
 on integrating a computer into a stereo system that provides control
 for music playback over a TCP/IP network.  The goals are to be easy to
 install and use, to have minimal resource requirements (it has been
 reported to run fine on a Pentium 75), and to remain stable and
 flexible.
 .
 The daemon is controlled through a client which need not run on the
 same computer mpd runs on.  The separate client and server design
 allows users to choose a user interface that best suites their tastes
 independently of the underlying daemon (this package) which actually
 plays music.

 in a VM and point VNC at). This allows testing of things including GUI
 applications, system boot-up (BIOS, bootloaders, kernels), installers and whole
 operating systems.
 .
 Tests (using Perl syntax) generally consist mostly of sequences of code like:
   assert_and_click 'some_icon';
   assert_screen 'some_prompt';
   send_key 'ret';
 which are run using the os-autoinst test engine, by a worker. The tags named in
 scripts can then be associated with 'needles' (elements of screenshots) via the
 webUI (either from past tests, or while controlling a live test). Other testing
 possibilities include: serial-connected headless systems, multi-host networked
 tests, and non-VM 'real' systems.
 .
 This package includes the job scheduler, the elements providing the services to
 allow workers to run tests and upload results, and the Web-based user

 anything that you can 'remotely' control. For instance, a VM that can be
 accessed via VNC.

Package: openqa-worker
Description-md5: 07676b829e1de30e9f36a262b2579cea
Description-en: automatic Operating System testing framework (worker)
 openQA is a testing framework that allows you to run tests on pretty-much
 anything that you can get 'remote' control of (most often, anything you can run
 in a VM and point VNC at). This allows testing of things including GUI
 applications, system boot-up (BIOS, bootloaders, kernels), installers and whole
 operating systems.
 .
 Tests (using Perl syntax) generally consist of little more than sequences like:
 assert_and_click 'some_icon'; assert_screen 'some_prompt'; send_key 'ret';
 which are run using the os-autoinst test engine, by a worker. The tags named in
 scripts can then be associated with 'needles' (elements of screenshots) via the
 webUI (either from past tests, or while controlling a live test). Other testing
 possibilities include: serial-connected headless systems, multi-host networked
 tests, and non-VM 'real' systems.
 .
 This package is to be installed on a worker system (which may also be acting as
 a server). Workers register with a server (or perhaps multiple servers), and
 can then accept jobs, and run tests (using the os-autoinst test engine).

 key bindings (reaction to user key presses). These default behaviors and key
 bindings can be overwritten on a per-application basis. Orca creates a script
 object for each running application, which merges both the default behaviors
 and key bindings, and the application specific ones. Orca provides the
 infrastructure to activate and deactivate scripts, as well as a host of
 services accessible from within the scripts.

Package: os-autoinst
Description-md5: 79248344378908d7be7c47060c26ab61
Description-en: automated testing of Operating Systems
 The OS-autoinst project aims at providing a means to run fully automated
 tests. Especially to run tests of basic and low-level operating system
 components such as bootloader, kernel, installer and upgrade, which can not
 easily and safely be tested with other automated testing frameworks.
 However, it can just as well be used to test firefox and openoffice operation
 on top of a newly installed OS.

 together with openQA, the web user interface that allows one to run more than
 one os-autoinst instance at the same time.

 CTDB is a cluster implementation of the TDB database used by Samba and other
 projects to store temporary data. If an application is already using TDB for
 temporary data it is very easy to convert that application to be cluster aware
 and use CTDB instead.
 .
 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,
 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.
 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

Description-md5: f715958427047f78c36a0bd75d1756e0
Description-en: Threadless, event-based XMPP Python 3 library
 Slixmpp is a (friendly) fork of SleekXMPP, which goal is to “improve” the
 core of the library by entirely removing all threads from the library and
 using an event-based approach instead.
 .
 Features of this library:
  * No threads. See http://blog.louiz.org/slixmpp. All parts of the API relying
    on threads are removed.
  * No support for Python < 3.4. This allows one to remove a lot of workaround
    and other hacks.
  * No backward compatibility with old SleekXMPP version. For example things
    like “addHandler = add_handler” are removed.
 .
 You should use this library only if you would prefer not to use threads in
 your application. If threads don’t really bother you, or if you need Python
 2 support, then you should use SleekXMPP instead.

Package: tor
Description-md5: 9106e8e4b3843ebd532ba2b89615a92e
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Package: tor-geoipdb
Description-md5: d0b50c9cd91157b8c85856fd55e26d14
Description-en: GeoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.

 VkFFT is an efficient GPU-accelerated multidimensional Fast Fourier
 Transform library for Vulkan/CUDA/HIP/OpenCL projects. VkFFT aims to
 provide the community with an open-source alternative to Nvidia's
 cuFFT library while achieving better performance. VkFFT is written in
 C language and supports Vulkan, CUDA, HIP and OpenCL as backends.
 .
  + 1D/2D/3D systems
 .
  + Forward and inverse directions of FFT
 .
  + Support for big FFT dimension sizes. Current limits: C2C or even
 C2R/R2C - (2^32, 2^32, 2^32). Odd C2R/R2C - (2^12, 2^32, 2^32). R2R -
 (2^12, 2^12, 2^12). Depends on the amount of shared memory on the
 device. (will be increased later).
 .
  + Radix-2/3/4/5/7/8/11/13 FFT. Sequences using radix 3, 5, 7, 11 and
 13 have comparable performance to that of powers of 2.
 .
  + Bluestein's FFT algorithm for all other sequences. Full coverage
 of C2C range, single upload (2^12, 2^12, 2^12) for
 R2C/C2R/R2R. Optimized to have as few memory transfers as possible by
 using zero padding and merged convolution support of VkFFT
 .
  + Single, double and half precision support. Double precision uses
 CPU-generated LUT tables. Half precision still does all computations
 in single and only uses half precision to store data.
 .
  + All transformations are performed in-place with no performance
 loss. Out-of-place transforms are supported by selecting different
 input/output buffers.
 .
  + No additional transposition uploads. Note: Data can be reshuffled
 after the Four Step FFT algorithm with an additional buffer (for big
 sequences). Doesn't matter for convolutions - they return to the
 input ordering (saves memory).
 .
  + Complex to complex (C2C), real to complex (R2C), complex to real
 (C2R) transformations and real to real (R2R) Discrete Cosine
 Transformations of types I, II, III and IV. R2R, R2C and C2R are
 optimized to run up to 2x times faster than C2C and take 2x less
 memory
 .
  + 1x1, 2x2, 3x3 convolutions with symmetric or nonsymmetric kernel
 (no register overutilization)
 .
  + Native zero padding to model open systems (up to 2x faster than
 simply padding input array with zeros). Can specify the range of
 sequences filled with zeros and the direction where zero padding is
 applied (read or write stage)
 .
  + WHDCN layout - data is stored in the following order (sorted by
 increase in strides): the width, the height, the depth, the
 coordinate (the number of feature maps), the batch number
 .
  + Multiple feature/batch convolutions - one input, multiple kernels
 .
  + Multiple input/output/temporary buffer split. Allows using data
 split between different memory allocations and mitigates 4GB single
 allocation limit.
 .
  + Works on Nvidia, AMD and Intel GPUs. And Raspberry Pi 4 GPU.
 .
  + Works on Windows, Linux and macOS
 .
  + VkFFT supports Vulkan, CUDA, HIP and OpenCL as backend to cover
 wide range of APIs
 .
  + Header-only library with Vulkan interface, which allows appending
 VkFFT directly to user's command buffer. Kernels are compiled at
 run-time

    learners to work on the same type of exercise but with different
    data and as often as they wish;
  * exercises with an automatic scoring system, which enhances learner
    motivation;
  * user-friendly graphics and calculation tools;
  * courses and documents with hyperlinks to the exercise pool;
    examples in the courses can be made random, so the student can get
    more than one instance of an illustration for tricky concepts;
  * support for exams with pre-published contents. As each individual
    exam will have randomly chosen data, training is possible but
    writing each response in advance is not.

Package: wsjtx
Description-md5: 33c670742043c463eb8dedc322001017
Description-en: Weak-signal amateur radio communications
 WSJT-X implements amateur radio communication protocols or "modes" called
 FST4, FST4W, FT4, FT8, JT4, JT9, JT65, Q65, MSK144, and WSPR, as well as one
 called Echo for detecting and measuring your own radio signals reflected from
 the Moon. These modes were all designed for making reliable, confirmed QSOs
 under extreme weak-signal conditions.
 .
 JT4, JT9, and JT65 use nearly identical message structure and source encoding
 (the efficient compression of standard messages used for minimal QSOs). They
 use timed 60-second T/R sequences synchronized with UTC. JT4 and JT65 were
 designed for EME ("moonbounce") on the VHF/UHF/microwave bands. JT9 is
 optimized for the MF, and HF bands. It is about 2 dB more sensitive than
 JT65 while using less than 10% of the bandwidth. Q65 offers submodes with a
 wide range of T/R sequence lengths and tone spacings.
 .
 FT4 and FT8 are operationally similar but use T/R cycles only 7.5 and 15 s
 long, respectively. MSK144 is designed for Meteor Scatter on the VHF bands.
 These modes offer enhanced message formats with support for nonstandard
 callsigns and some popular contests.
 .
 FST4 and FST4W are designed particularly for the LF and MF bands. On these
 bands their fundamental sensitivities are better than other WSJT-X modes with
 the same sequence lengths, approaching the theoretical limits for their rates
 of information throughput. FST4 is optimized for two-way QSOs, while FST4W is
 for quasi-beacon transmissions of WSPR-style messages. FST4 and FST4W do not
 require the strict, independent time synchronization and phase locking of
 modes like EbNaut.
 .
 WSPR mode implements a protocol designed for probing potential propagation
 paths with low-power transmissions. WSPR is fully implemented within WSJT-X,
 including programmable "band-hopping".
 .
 This package does not contain non-free components required for "superfox"
 operation. See README.Debian for more details.
